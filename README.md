# rpgtuner
Application for fine tuning pen and paper RPGs


The idea behind this is to be able to fine tune stats, armor, etc. and see their impact on combat(initially).

Player stats will be pulled in, from the app or database and then run through a simulator that simulates ~1000 combats.

Stats will be displayed.

Eventually the stats will be broken down and displayed in a graph format as well as being able to compare combat stats to the previous run.

Firebase will be used as the database provider.

Proposed Features.

Save Characters, Save Builds, Save combat stats, visualized data, simulators for different encounters.
